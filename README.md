# Dataset 1: Transit Oriented Districts 
Name: Transit Oriented Districts (TODs)

Description: From the County of Los Angeles Enterprise GIS website, this data set demonstrates "urban and suburban areas near major transit and commercial corridors having the most potential for infill development, especially higher density housing and mixed uses". I can use this in my research to see where there are current investments in Los Angeles for TODs and see where there are apparent lack of transiet oriented communities.

# Dataset 2: Los Angeles Transit Stops
Name: Los Angeles Transit Stops, April 2020

Description: an ARCGIS map that shows the data from each Metro bus stop and the number of ridership on the weekdays and weekends in April 2020. This map is unique because it tracks every single metro bus stop and how many people get on and off and shows peak riderships on different points on the map. This data can be very useful to illustrating the exact areas in Los Angeles of highest ridership, as well as visualizing the use of different bus lines throughout the city. This can be used in comparison to the dataset above to see where there is TODs being built versus the reality of high volume transit use.
