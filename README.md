# Dataset 1: Transit Oriented Districts 
Name: Transit Oriented Disctricts (TODs)

Description: From the County of Los Angeles Enterprise GIS website, this data set demonstrates "urban and suburban areas near major transit and commercial corridors having the most potential for infill development, especially higher density housing and mixed uses". I can use this in my research to see where there are current investments in Los Angeles for TODs and see where there are apparent lack of transiet oriented communities.
